📊part 1 — Retail Sales Data Visualization System  

📝 Project Overview  
The **Retail Sales Data Visualization System** is a SQL-driven analytics project designed to analyze, visualize, and interpret retail transaction data. It demonstrates full-cycle data analytics — from relational database design to dashboard visualization — enabling data-informed retail decision-making.

---

🗂️ Database Design  
Structured **relational SQL database** with 10 interconnected tables:

- Customers  
- Products  
- Stores  
- Sales Transactions  
- Employees  
- Regions  
- Time Dimensions  
- Categories  
- Payments  
- Discounts  

Each table is normalized up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, ensuring data accuracy, referential integrity, and scalability.

---

⚙️ Core Functionalities  

- **Sales Performance Analysis:** Track revenue, profit margins, and best-selling products.  
- **Customer Insights:** Identify purchase frequency and high-value segments.  
- **Regional & Time Trends:** Explore seasonal and geographic sales patterns.  
- **Employee Performance:** Assess sales efficiency by representative or branch.  
- **Promotion Analysis:** Measure the impact of discounts and payment types on total revenue.  

---

🧠 SQL Implementation  

- **DDL:** Schema creation using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` statements.  
- **DML:** Data operations with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.  
- **DQL:** Insight extraction through complex `SELECT`, joins, and aggregations.  
- **CTEs & Subqueries:** Multi-level analysis (top 5 products, revenue by category).  
- **Views & Stored Procedures:** Reusable analytics and automated tasks.  

---

📈 Visualization (Power BI / Tableau)  

Key dashboards include:  
- **Sales Overview:** Revenue trends and category-wise performance.  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Repeat vs. new customer analysis.  
- **Regional Analysis:** Store sales by region and time.  
- **Discount Effectiveness:** Impact of promotions on profits.  
- **Employee KPIs:** Top performers and efficiency metrics.  

---

🚀 Impact  

This system enhances retail analytics by:  
- Reducing manual reporting time  
- Enabling real-time business insights  
- Supporting decision-making through visual data exploration  
- Encouraging collaboration via shared BI dashboards

⚡Part 2 — Washington State Electric & Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle Analysis  

### 🧾 Dataset  
**Dataset:** Washington State Electric & Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles  
**Source:** Washington State Department of Licensing  
**Tool Used:** Tableau  

---

🧩 Data Dictionary (Key Columns)
- **VIN (1-10):** First 10 characters of the Vehicle Identification Number  
- **County / City / State / Postal Code:** Location of registered vehicle owner  
- **Model Year / Make / Model:** Vehicle details  
- **Electric Vehicle Type:** BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) or PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid)  
- **CAFV Eligibility:** Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle eligibility  
- **Electric Range:** Distance the vehicle travels on electric charge  
- **Base MSRP:** Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price  
- **Legislative District / Electric Utility:** Regional mapping  
- **2020 Census Tract:** Census-based location ID  

---

🎯 Objectives  

 **1. Descriptive Analysis**
Gain familiarity with Tableau and build foundational visuals:  
- Vehicles by **Make**, **Model**, and **Model Year**  
- **Geographic maps** showing vehicle distribution by City or County  
- Visualize **Electric Vehicle Type** distribution (BEV vs PHEV)  
- Highlight **CAFV Eligibility** status counts  

---

**2. Advanced Descriptive Analysis**  
Identify deeper patterns using calculated fields and comparative visuals.  

**Calculated Fields:**
- **Electric Range Category:**
  - Unknown: 0  
  - Short Range: ≤ 100  
  - Moderate Range: 101–200  
  - Long Range: 201–300  
  - Very Long Range: > 300  
- **Age Category:**
  - Recent: ≥ 2020  
  - Mid-Decade: 2015–2019  
  - Older: ≤ 2014  

**Visualizations:**
- Electric Range Category vs. Vehicle Make  
- MSRP comparison across eligibility and age categories  
- Scatter chart showing **MSRP vs. Electric Range**  

---

 **3. Diagnostic Analysis**
Explore *why* certain trends exist using Tableau parameters and filters.  

**Tasks:**
- Create **filter by vehicle make**  
- Add **parameter: Minimum Range Threshold**  
- Enable dynamic dashboard filtering  
- Highlight **dominant make–range combinations** by region or utility provider  
- Diagnose regional disparities in clean vehicle adoption (range, age, MSRP)  

---

 **4. Dashboard & Storytelling**
Compile a cohesive Tableau dashboard and narrative including:  
- Overview visuals (Activity 1)  
- Trend analysis (Activity 2)  
- Diagnostic dashboard with parameters (Activity 3)  
- Storyboard titled: **“What did we discover and what decisions could this inform?”**

---

 📊 Key Insights  

- Tesla, Chevrolet, and Nissan dominate in long-range electric models.  
- Urban counties show higher BEV adoption, influenced by utility availability.  
- CAFV eligibility correlates with newer models and longer electric ranges.  
- Higher MSRP vehicles typically have extended electric ranges, showing premium pricing trends.
